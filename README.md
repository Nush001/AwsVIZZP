# AwsVIZZP
This is my first AWS QuickSight visualization project. I used Amazon S3 and Amazon QuickSight to create cool visualizations from an Amazon dataset.

This project is perfect for beginners and involves just a few steps. Based on a tutorial by Tech with Lucy, it teaches you how to use Quicksight for data visualization and analysis. Quicksight is an AWS tool that helps you create interactive dashboards and reports using your data. Here’s what you’ll do: download a dataset of 50,000 best-selling Amazon products from GitHub, store it in an Amazon S3 bucket, and connect the S3 bucket with Amazon Quicksight to make some cool visualizations. This hands-on project is a great way to learn how to use Amazon S3 and Quicksight for awesome data visualizations.
